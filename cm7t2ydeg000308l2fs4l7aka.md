> JavaScript is a versatile language widely used for web development, offering ease of learning and flexibility. TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript, provides static typing and enhanced error-checking, making it a better choice for large, team-based projects. This article explores the key differences, advantages of each language, and guidance on when to use TypeScript, along with resources to start learning it.

ðŸš€ JavaScript is everywhere! It is the most popular language for web development. But now, many developers are using **TypeScript**. Is it better? Should you switch? Let's find out!

## **1\. What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript (JS) is a **programming language** for the web. It helps create interactive websites. You can use JS to make buttons work, load content, and even build games!

### **Example**

Here is a simple JavaScript code:

```javascript
javascriptCopiarEditarfunction sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

sayHello();
```

ðŸ“Œ This function prints "Hello, world!" in the console.

## **2\. What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript (TS) is **JavaScript with extra features**. It helps developers find errors before running the code. Big companies use TypeScript because it makes projects **safer and easier** to manage.

### **Example**

Here is the same function, but in TypeScript:

```typescript
typescriptCopiarEditarfunction sayHello(): void {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

sayHello();
```

ðŸ“Œ TypeScript adds `: void` to show that the function does not return a value.

## **3\. Key Differences Between JavaScript and TypeScript**

| Feature | JavaScript | TypeScript |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Typing** | No types (dynamic) | Uses types (static) |
| **Errors** | Found at runtime | Found before running |
| **Used for** | Small projects | Big projects |
| **Learning** | Easy | A little harder |
